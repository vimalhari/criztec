            Why Your Business Needs a Mobile App
          </h2>
          <p>
            In today's digital-first world, mobile applications have become essential tools for businesses of all sizes.
            With smartphone usage at an all-time high in the UK, a well-designed mobile app can:

        <div class="content-section">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white mb-2">Enhance Customer Engagement</h3>
          <p>
            Mobile apps provide a direct channel to your customers, allowing you to send personalized notifications,
            offers, and updates. This direct interaction builds stronger relationships and increases customer loyalty.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white mb-2">Boost Brand Visibility</h3>
          <p>
            Your app icon on a user's phone serves as a constant reminder of your brand. The average smartphone user
            checks their phone 58 times daily, providing multiple opportunities for brand recognition.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white mb-2">Create New Revenue Streams</h3>
          <p>
            Mobile apps open up various monetization opportunities—from in-app purchases and subscription models to
            premium features and ad revenue. They can complement your existing business model or create entirely new
            income sources.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white mb-2">Collect Valuable User Data</h3>
          <p>
            Apps provide insights into user behavior, preferences, and engagement patterns. This data helps you make
            informed business decisions, personalize user experiences, and optimize your marketing strategies.
