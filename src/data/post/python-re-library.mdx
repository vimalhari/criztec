Python's `re` library, the cornerstone of regular expressions, is an indispensable tool for developers dealing with text manipulation. Whether you're extracting data, validating input, or transforming strings, mastering `re` can significantly streamline your workflow. This article dives into three powerful examples that demonstrate the versatility and practicality of Python's regular expressions.

## What are Regular Expressions?

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They provide a concise and flexible way to match, locate, and manipulate text within strings. Think of them as a highly advanced "find and replace" tool on steroids.

## Why Use Python's `re` Library?

Python's built-in `re` module offers a robust implementation of regular expressions. Here's why you should leverage it:

- **Efficiency:** Quickly process large amounts of text data.
- **Flexibility:** Handle complex patterns with ease.
- **Built-in:** No need for external dependencies.
- **Widely Used:** A standard tool in a Python developer's toolkit.

## 3 Practical Examples of Python's `re` Library in Action

Let's explore these examples to showcase the capabilities of Python's `re` library:

### 1. Extracting Email Addresses from Text

Extracting email addresses from a large block of text is a common task. This example shows how to use `re` to identify and isolate email addresses efficiently.

**Problem:** Given a text document, extract all valid email addresses.

**Solution:**

Python

```
import re

text = """
Contact us at info@example.com or support@company.net for assistance.
You can also reach John Doe at john.doe123@subdomain.example.co.uk or Jane at jane-doe@email.org.
Invalid email like @invalid.com or missing@ should not be matched.
"""

email_pattern = r"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}"

emails = re.findall(email_pattern, text)

print("Extracted Email Addresses:")
for email in emails:
    print(email)
```

**Code Explanation:**

1. **`import re`:** Imports the `re` module.
2. **`email_pattern`:** Defines the regular expression pattern for matching email addresses.
   - `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: Matches the local part (before `@`).
   - `@`: Matches the literal "@" symbol.
   - `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Matches the domain name part.
   - `\.`: Matches the dot before the top-level domain.
   - `[a-zA-Z]{2,}`: Matches the top-level domain (e.g., "com", "org").
3. **`re.findall(email_pattern, text)`:** Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the text.
4. **Output:** Prints the list of extracted emails.

**Output:**

```
Extracted Email Addresses:
info@example.com
support@company.net
john.doe123@subdomain.example.co.uk
jane-doe@email.org
```

### 2. Validating Phone Numbers with Regular Expressions

Phone number formats can vary. This example demonstrates how to validate phone numbers against specific patterns using `re`.

**Problem:** Validate US phone numbers in the format `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` or `XXX-XXX-XXXX`.

**Solution:**

Python

```
import re

def validate_phone_number(phone_number):
    """Validates US phone numbers in the format (XXX) XXX-XXXX or XXX-XXX-XXXX."""
    pattern = r"^\(?(\d{3})\)?[- ]?(\d{3})[- ]?(\d{4})$"
    match = re.match(pattern, phone_number)
    return bool(match)

phone_numbers = [
    "(123) 456-7890",
    "123-456-7890",
    "123 456 7890",
    "1234567890",  # Invalid format
    "(123)456-7890", # valid format
    "abc-def-ghij",  # Invalid format
    "(123-456-7890", # Invalid format
    "123) 456-7890", # Invalid format
]

print("Phone Number Validation:")
for number in phone_numbers:
    print(f"{number}: {validate_phone_number(number)}")
```

**Code Explanation:**

1. **`pattern`:** Defines the regex pattern for US phone numbers.
   - `^` and `$`: Ensure the entire string is matched.
   - `\(?` and `\)?`: Allow optional parentheses.
   - `(\d{3})`: Captures three digits.
   - `[- ]?`: Allows an optional hyphen or space as a separator.
2. **`re.match(pattern, phone_number)`:** Matches the pattern against the phone number.
3. **`return bool(match)`:** Returns `True` if valid, `False` otherwise.

**Output:**

```
Phone Number Validation:
(123) 456-7890: True
123-456-7890: True
123 456 7890: True
1234567890: False
(123)456-7890: True
abc-def-ghij: False
(123-456-7890: False
123) 456-7890: False
```

### 3. Replacing Text with HTML Tags for Formatting

Regular expressions can also be used to transform text. Here's how to convert text between asterisks into bold HTML tags.

**Problem:** Convert text enclosed in single asterisks (e.g., `*bold text*`) to bold text using HTML tags (`<b>`).

**Solution:**

Python

```
import re

def bold_text(text):
    """Converts text enclosed in asterisks to bold HTML tags."""
    pattern = r"\*(.*?)\*"
    return re.sub(pattern, r"<b>\1</b>", text)

text = "This is some *sample text* with *bold words*."
html_text = bold_text(text)
print(html_text)
```

**Code Explanation:**

1. **`pattern`:** Defines the pattern to find text within asterisks.
   - `\*`: Matches literal asterisks.
   - `(.*?)`: Captures any characters between the asterisks (non-greedy).
2. **`re.sub(pattern, r"<b>\1</b>", text)`:** Replaces the matched pattern with `<b>` + captured text + `</b>`.
   - `\1`: Refers to the captured group (the text inside the asterisks).

**Output:**

```
This is some <b>sample text</b> with <b>bold words</b>.
```

## Conclusion

The Python `re` library is a powerful and versatile tool for working with text. These examples demonstrate just a fraction of what's possible. By mastering regular expressions, you can efficiently extract information, validate data, and manipulate strings, significantly enhancing your Python programming skills.
